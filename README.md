# rain-shine

This is a weather app that displays the current weather, as well as a 5 day forecast for the week ahead, of any city. I created this app using a third-party API from OpenWeather, calling upon their Current Weather Data API, as well as their OneCall API. I utilized Bootstrap for much of the formatting and styling, as well as creating my own styles in an external stylesheet. The app stores any cities you search for into your computer's local storage so that every time you revisit the website, you will see a history of those cities.

## Usage

When you first get to the page, you can type in any city, and that cities weather data will be displayed. A button will be created with the cities name underneath the search box. If you enter a new city, that cities weather data will replace the first city, and another new button will be added to the list at the top. If you click a button that has already been created, that cities weather day will be displayed. I have also added a delete button that will remove a city from this list, in case you decide you do not want it as part of your search history.

First I must credit the UCLA Extension Full-Stack Web Development Coding Bootcamp, instructor Bryan Swarthout, and TA Wilson Lam for providing me with all of the tools and knowledge I used to build this weather app.
